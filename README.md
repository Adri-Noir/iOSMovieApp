This is a project for iOS class on FER hosted by Five

I'm not really happy with how the 3rd homework turned out. I think a lot 
of things are rushed and some things need to be better for example all the 
models and filters. I should have guarded everything related to the 
network data. Everything that was required works and I think it looks 
pretty decent. The code is garbage and I should definitely work on that. I 
also fixed some issues brought up at the last code review (search 
results are now in the CollectionView and all the images are guarded).
